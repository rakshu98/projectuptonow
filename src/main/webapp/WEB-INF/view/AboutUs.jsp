Understanding the need to give back to the community and nature in general, Shopping cart bought a small army of employees interested in the project. They came and got themselves dirty in order to do their bit to cleaning up. Enjoying the process, our employees were involved in contributing to the campaign, which aims at having zero dependency on electricity for treating sewage water.

Venkata Siva Rao Kota, Senior Manager, Software Development, Prime, who was at the lake with his team, said, "We come to work on this side of town every day but really never knew that a lake existed in this vicinity. Now that we here and we have seen first hand how our efforts can make a difference to this lake, we are all geared up to make a difference." Similar was the experience of Senior Manager, Fin Ops, Gaurav Prasad and his team. "Those of us in Bangalore constantly hear of lake frothing and dying lakes. So, when we learnt that this lake in such close proximity to the office we decided to chip in with our efforts and help beautify the premises," said Gaurav..</p>

            <p>One of the biggest issues plaguing the city of Bangalore has undoubtedly been its incapability to control the waste and sewage being dumped into its lakes. Bangalore, which is home to many lakes – Ulsoor, BTM and Bellandur for example, has seen pollutants spoil the natural beauty and quality of water in their lakes. Mahadevpura Lake is another example where the levels of pollution had reached an unbearable level and to mitigate this, Amazon India teamed up with the BBMP and United Way Bengaluru to construct a sewage treatment plant. There are many monitoring systems which will ensure that the STP works at an optimal level. The Centre for DEWATS Dissemination Society (CDD) and BORDA, a German Technology firm have provided technical expertise for installation of the STP. The civil construction is being led by Revlon Engineers.</p>

          <p class="lead">Earlier if there is anything new in the market, I had to ask my friends in Chennai or Mumbai to ship it to me; but with Shopping cart, my shopping has become easier,” says Shopping cart customer, A.H. Harish. It is interesting to note what customers want on these islands. Interestingly, quite a lot of chips, masala packets, mayonnaise and eatables are ordered online, as well as ladders and brooms! A story goes that just to check if online shopping works, a customer had once bought a ₹2 dog bone!
Delivering to the last mile within Indian territories has vastly benefited consumers in the Andaman Islands. It has also touched the lives of local delivery associates. Take the case of Nayan, a delivery associate with Shopping cart, who takes great pride in providing services to customers on the island. It has brought him meaningful employment with a large organisation that is so local to his state and island. It has also brought him new found respect because of the customer delight he brings. Adds Awanish, “We are confident that operations will continue to have a multiplier effect on the island by enabling entrepreneurs, skilling youth and creating employment.</p>

          <p class="lead">Rinku Singh, a differently-abled associate says, “I was working with Mirakle Couriers and doing normal courier deliveries (paper, documents, cheques, etc.) for multiple clients. Mirakle Courier’s association with Amazon gave me an opportunity to understand the organized way of delivery in e-commerce. I was able to unleash technology used in Amazon for timely deliveries and providing enhanced customer experience. This way of working also helped me to do maximum deliveries and I complete my work on time which is why I am now able to focus on my family. After I started doing quality deliveries I also started earning my incentives because of which my income has increased which is always a good thing!” As the Station grows from strength to strength, we are told that this would not be possible without the investment of these “special associates.” When a new differently abled associate joins, a tenured differently abled associate provides training. Initially he will travel along with the new associate, and help him identify landmarks which helps the new associate to do faster deliveries. They also practice the same on hand drawn maps and use of technology like Whatsapp video calling.</p>
